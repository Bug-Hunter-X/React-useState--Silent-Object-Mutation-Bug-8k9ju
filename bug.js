This bug occurs when using the `useState` hook in React with an object as the initial state.  If you try to directly modify the object's properties within a state update function, React won't rerender the component because the state reference remains the same. This is because JavaScript objects are passed by reference. 

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [myObject, setMyObject] = useState({ count: 0 });

  const incrementCount = () => {
    myObject.count++; // Incorrect: Does not trigger a re-render
    setMyObject(myObject); // This does not work as expected 
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {myObject.count}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
